# Assignment

## "Dropbox" Homework:

Build an application to synchronize a source folder and a destination folder over IP:

1.1 - a simple command-line client which takes one directory as an argument and keeps monitoring changes in that directory and uploads any change to its server

1.2 - a simple server which takes one empty directory as an argument and receives any change from its client

Bonus - optimize data transfer by avoiding uploading the same file multiple times

Bonus - optimize data transfer by avoiding uploading the same content multiple times content (files which fully or partially share the same content)

## Constraints
Please try to avoid high-level libraries such as librsync

## FAQ

Q: Am I allowed to use diff and 3-way merge libraries similar to: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/difflib.html https://pypi.org/project/merge3/

A: There are bonuses associated with the task that require to implement some sort of binary diff mechanism or approach of reusing data from existing files. Libraries like rsync or some linux utilities or high level diff libraries just give you such functionality for free. We don't want you to use these libraries. It is OK if you read a paper about rsync algorithm and implement it yourself or go with something simpler but your own approach. The key here is that we want you to have a firm understanding of how it works and you to be able to implement it yourself. Bandwidth saving optimisations should be implemented by you without using libraries. For any other functionality like file monitoring, network transport & protocol etc you can use third party libraries. Also, I want to mention, just because a lot of people ask about it, that the homework should work with any file types - binary or text it should not matter.

Q: How deep should I go with this project? Even such a (small) project could potentially become quite complex. It depends on level of details.

A: It is a very good question. The possibilities to "go deep" in this homework are endless. It is very interesting for us to see where a candidate decides to focus and where they decide to cut corners. If you want to, feel free to demonstrate your "strong suit": if you're a multithreading expert, put emphasis on parallel implementation; if you're into security -- implement something extra about that, and so on. That is why it is proven to be very useful for us. It is expected that you will not be able to implement everything you have on your mind. Just tell us about those areas where you would like things to improve. Keep that in mind.
